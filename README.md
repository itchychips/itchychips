- 👋 Hi, I’m @itchychips
- 👀 I’m interested in coding as a hobby.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Erlang and its OTP framework.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything AGPL, especially Erlang.
- 📫 How to reach me itchychips@itchyeyes.net

Elaboration on AGPL:

Too many companies have co-opted open source projects.  While I do not think that any of my projects will gain enough traction to be used by a company without just and fair compensation, it's easier to relax a license than to tighten it.  Additionally, a negotiation can happen according to the value of the code that I created, and I can re-license it after such value has been justly compensated.

If I accept contributors, I don't require copyright reassignment to myself\*, which means negotiation will have to happen with *all* copyright holders for just compensation.  If we can't reach a consensus, tough luck!

\* -  and, if I did, I would draft a work-made-for-hire contract for such a thing with just compensation for the person's time
